This is a simple Ruby project that encrypts a string using the Caesar Cipher method.

In Caesar Cipher, a letter is taken and then substituted to another letter based on the shift factor. 

The shift factor is number of positions used to substitute the letter in the alphabet.

For example, if the shift factor is 3, and the letter is "B", then it shifts from "B" to "C", "D", then "E". That is the encryption. It steps over 3 times and replaces that letter.
